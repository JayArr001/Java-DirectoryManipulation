# Java-DirectoryManipulation
This is a single-class project that illustrates the author's skill in creating, accessing and recording information about directories, plus subfiles/subdirectories in Java. 
It uses NIO2 functionality and recursively calls its writing function to achieve its output.</br>
</br>
The output from this program are 3 folders and 3 text files in total; 1 parent and 2 subfolders nested within each other, with text files accompanying each. Inside the text files are the current path and listed subcontents.
These files/folders are created in the same working directory that the program is executed from.
As an optional step, users can run the program once, then add extra files to the directories or subdirectories. A subsequent run of the program should correctly include these new items inside the text files.</br>
</br>
This program is intended to showcase the author's skills and familiarity with the following (non-exhaustive) Java topics:</br>
Path/Data formatting</br>
Recursion</br>
File generation</br>
Writing to files</br>
Generation, protection and passing of data structures</br>
</br>
Users can run this program by acquiring only Main.java, then executing it by targeting Main.java in a command prompt using Java, or running Main.java inside an IDE.
